	<h2>What is Edge?</h2>
	Edge is a personal effort to bring web application development up to par with other notable platforms. For example, Edge is highly inspired by both Express (for node.js) and the Play!Framework for Java. Its goal is to enable  developers to quickly build application, while leveraging the benefits of the Vert.x platform.
